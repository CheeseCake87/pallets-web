# Report an Issue

Include the following information in your post:

-   Describe what you expected to happen.
-   If possible, include a `minimal reproducible example`_ to help us
    identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with
    your own code.
-   Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there
    was an exception.
-   List your Python and Flask versions. If possible, check if this
    issue is already fixed in the latest releases or the latest code in
    the repository.
