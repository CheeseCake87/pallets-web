# Contribute to Documentation

We use [Sphinx][] and [ReStructuredText][] to write the documentation. 
To build the docs locally, change to the `docs` directory and run `make html`.

Open `_build/html/index.html` in your browser to view the docs.

Build the docs in the ``docs`` directory using Sphinx.

.. code-block:: text

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

Open ``_build/html/index.html`` in your browser to view the docs.
