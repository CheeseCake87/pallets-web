# Asking and Answering Questions

Please don't use the issue tracker for this. The issue tracker is a tool
to address bugs and feature requests in Flask itself. Use one of the
following resources for questions about using Flask or issues with your
own code:

-   The ``#questions`` channel on our Discord chat:
    https://discord.gg/pallets
-   Ask on `Stack Overflow`_. Search with Google first using:
    ``site:stackoverflow.com flask {search term, exception message, etc.}``
-   Ask on our `GitHub Discussions`_ for long term discussion or larger
    questions.
